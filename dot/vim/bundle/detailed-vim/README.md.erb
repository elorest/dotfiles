<%= `rake lang_stats` %>

Note that for fully supported languages (Ruby), you get the whole experience of having the subtle color shades that fingerprint and lint the code when you glance at it.

For the lesser grades mentioned above, you should get a bit more, but know that the `syntax/[yourlang].vim` has to have enough semantic parsing to make this possible. If you want to go further, you can certainly get a patch in that enhances the syntax parsing inside vim-detailed's `colors/detailed.vim` file.

For all other languages, even the ones not listed above, you should at least get:
- Rainbow parens/brackets/curlies (which can be very helpful when the syntax gets deep)
- Quiet comments (grey, because "a comment is a lie waiting to happen")
- Strings with gray background (so it looks like a solid chunk)
- Muted colorcolumn (gray instead of GIANT LOUD RED)
- A color palette somewhat consistent with the detailed ones

## Issues:

<%= `ghi list` %>

## Troubleshooting
