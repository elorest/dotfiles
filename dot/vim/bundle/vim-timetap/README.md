timetap.vim
===========

A precise time tracker for Vim. Inspired by the
[TimeTap](https://github.com/elia/timetap) plugin for TextMate.

> Once you've launched Vim you don't have to bother anymore
starting/stopping timers or investing some arbitrary amount of time to fill your
fancy time tracker.

Exactly. timetap.vim use auto commands to achieve these goals.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and the simply copy and
paste:

    git clone git://github.com/rainerborene/vim-timetap.git ~/.vim/bundle/timetap

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git) is very cool system to manage plugins as well.
You just run command `:BundleInstall rainerborene/vim-timetap` inside Vim.  
And also put `Bundle 'rainerborene/vim-timetap'` into `.vimrc`.
